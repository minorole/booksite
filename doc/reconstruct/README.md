Booksite Reconstruction Docs (/doc/reconstruct)

Purpose
- Central place to plan, decide, and track the ongoing reconstruction per doc/new-plans/rewrite-roadmap.md.
- Keep work scoped, reversible, and auditable without touching runtime code.
- Make ownership clear for each slice with acceptance and validation steps.

How To Use
- Read plan.md for milestones and scope per slice.
- Use checklists/* for task-by-task execution with acceptance for each task.
- Follow runbooks/* to validate a slice end-to-end.
- Capture architectural decisions in adr/* with context and consequences.
- Update status.md after each change; add a dated log entry in log/.

Status Conventions
- planned: agreed but not started
- in-progress: being implemented
- done: implemented and validated
